Definition:
    The Adapter Pattern allows two incompatible interfaces to work together by acting as a bridge between them.
    In this example, PhonePe integrates with different bank APIs (SBI, HDFC) that expose inconsistent interfaces. The Adapter pattern helps standardize access without changing the bank APIs


Real-World Analogy:
    A charging adapter allows your iPhone charger to plug into a power socket with a different shape â€” the adapter "translates" one interface to another.
