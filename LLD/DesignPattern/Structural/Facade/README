Definition:
    -   The Facade Pattern provides a simplified, high-level interface to a complex subsystem.
    -   It hides the underlying complexity by combining multiple operations behind one method.

Why?:
    -   To make the system easier to use for clients.
    -   To provide a single entry point to multiple systems.

How to Implement?:
    1. Identify the subsystems involved.
        - Each has its own complex setup or functionality (TV, Lights, Speakers...).

    2. Create a Facade struct(HomeTheaterFacade) that:
        - Holds references to these subsystems.
        - Offers one or a few methods that hide all the internal steps.

    3. Use the Facade from your client code.

Real-World Analogy:
    1.  ATM Machine
        -   Internally: Bank APIs, Card Reader, PIN Validator, Cash Dispenser
        -   Facade: Press "Withdraw ₹1000" → All done behind the scenes

    2.  Movie Night Button
        -   Press one button → Lights dim, TV turns on, speakers play sound
        -   You don't need to operate each device manually
