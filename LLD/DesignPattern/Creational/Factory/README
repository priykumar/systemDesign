Definition:
    Factory pattern is like a machine (factory) that builds and gives you the right object based on what you ask for.
    Instead of using `new` or `&Type{}`, you call a factory function like `NewDatabase("mysql")`.

When to Use?
    - When object creation logic is complex or repetitive
    - When you want to hide the details of object creation

Limitations
    - Violates OCP: Adding a new database type requires modifying `NewDatabase()`

Real-World Analogy
    > You don’t make your coffee yourself.  
    > You just tell the starbucks: “I want a Latte” → and they give it to you.  
    > That’s the factory deciding what to make based on your input.
